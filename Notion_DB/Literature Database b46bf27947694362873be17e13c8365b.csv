The Relationships Between Classroom Air Quality and Children’s Performance in School,High,IAQ,"Academic Performance, CO2, Indoor Air Quality, Learning","The article is a systematic review of the impact of classroom air quality on children's academic performance. The study found that indoor air quality has a significant impact on students' performance in school. ","The analysis predicts that reducing CO2 concentration from 2,100 ppm to 900 ppm would improve the performance of psychological tests and school tasks by 12% with respect to the speed at which the tasks are performed and by 2% with respect to errors made

Reducing the CO2 concentration from 2,400 ppm to 900 ppm would improve the performance of national tests and school-leaving examinationss by 5% and reducing CO2 from 4,200 ppm to 1,000 ppm would increase children’s daily attendance by 2.5%.",Science of The Total Environment Volume,Done,"April 4, 2023 6:17 PM","April 7, 2023 11:23 AM","April 9, 2023"

Predictive Digital Twins,High,"AI/ML, Digital Twin",Digital Twin,"A digital twin is an evolving virtual model that mirrors an individual physical asset throughout its lifecycle. Key to the digital twin concept is the ability to sense, collect, analyze, and learn from the asset’s data. To make digital twins a reality, many elements of the interdisciplinary field of computational science, including physics-based modeling and simulation, inverse problems, uncertainty quantification, and scientific machine learning, have an important role to play.
In this work, we develop a probabilistic graphical model as a formal mathematical representation of a digital twin and its associated physical asset. We create an abstraction of the asset-twin system as a set of coupled dynamical systems, evolving over time through their respective state-spaces and interacting via observed data and control inputs. The abstraction is realized computationally as a dynamic decision network. Predictive capabilities are enabled by physics-based reduced-order models. We demonstrate how the approach is instantiated to create, update and deploy a structural digital twin of an unmanned aerial vehicle.",,EPFL,Done,"April 25, 2023 6:26 PM","April 25, 2023 8:33 PM","April 25, 2023"
